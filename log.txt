Iteration 2:
Meeting Minutes
- First Meeting: Discussed implementation of database and assigned tasks(30 minutes).
- Second Meeting: Continued working on the assigned tasks (120 minutes) 
---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
Plan Changes
**Meal planner and survey will be added to the main window in the next iteration. Some functionalities
are only implemented using stub database and will have to be implemented using the real database in
the next iteration such as the "Favorite Recipes". Search by category of meal time is only 
implemented for data from the real database and not stub database. "Adding ingredients" is not yet fully implementeed.
These functionalities will be fully implemented in the next iteration.Also, the design of the 
pages are not consistent and this will be fixed in the next iteration.

Iteration 3:
Meeting Minutes
- First Meeting: Discussed final implementation of project database and UI and assigned tasks(60 minutes).
- Second Meeting: Continued working on the assigned tasks (120 minutes).
-Third Meeting: Tested code (60 minutes).
-Fourth Meeting: Refractored code and discussed remaining tasks (60 minutes).
---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
Plan Changes
-Time was allocated to complete user stories from iteration 2. 
-The user story of "adding recipes from websites" was removed due to low priority of this task. The time allocated to this task was spend on refactoring code and enhancing desing of GUI.
-Recommendation functionality in meal planner was supposed to take into account the user's answers to a series of survey questions such as favoirte cuisine, but due 
to time constraints, this was not implemented. The survey was removed and the recipe recommendation only takes into account user's allergies.
- The feature of adding price calculator for each recipe in the meal planner page was removed because we didn't have access to the cost of all ingredients in recipes unless the user entered them.
